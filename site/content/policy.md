### Google Sheets API with Read-only Scope

Our Auto Clicker - AutoFill extension uses the Google Sheets API with read-only and userinfo.profile scopes to access data from Google Sheets and show which Google account is connected. This API allows us to streamline the form-filling process and provide a better user experience for our users.

To use the Google Sheets API, we require permission to access your Google Sheets, read the data within them, and access your Google profile information. When you grant permission, we will only access the Google Sheets that you select, and we will only be able to read the data in them. We do not collect or store any of your personal information, including your Google account credentials.

The data from your Google Sheets will only be used to fill forms on configured websites/applications and to provide you with a better experience. We also use the userinfo.profile scope to show which Google account is connected. We do not store this data on our servers, nor do we use it for any purpose other than filling forms on configured websites/applications and showing the connected Google account.

We will not share your data with any third parties, except as required by law.

Auto Clicker - AutoFill's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.
