### Improved Logging System
We have improved logging of our extension to see the flow of extension also if it breaks any where we can pin down same.

It tracks all steps from `Configuration` -> `Batch` -> `Action` -> `Event`.

`Action` and `Batch` are grouped to understand its action better. You can collapse or expand group to have more clear view.
