## Dynamic Xpath
{{<callout info>}}
- [batch-repeat]({{<docsref "/configuration/batch#repeat">}}) with xpath to iterate over elements one by one. e.g if Xpath of element is like table format and you need to iterate all its row one by one. `//table/tr[1]/td[1]/button` this xpath will select button of fist row.
  **Examples**
    - `//table/tr[<batchRepeat>]/td[1]/button`
-  [action-repeat]({{<docsref "/action/overview#repeat">}}) with xpath to iterate over elements one by one. e.g if Xpath of element is like table format and you need to iterate all its row one by one. `//table/tr[1]/td[1]/button`
  **Examples**
    - `//table/tr[<batchRepeat>]/td[1<actionRepeat>]/button`
- [session-count]({{<docsref "/session/overview">}}) with xpath to iterate over elements one by one. e.g if Xpath of element is like table format and you need to iterate all its row one by one. `//table/tr[1]/td[1]/button` this xpath will select button of fist row. 
  **Examples**
    - `//table/tr[1]/td[1<sessionCount>]/button`
