## Toggles the visibility of action columns in a table.
This function is used to show or hide specific action columns such as [name]({{<docsref "/action/name">}}), [init-wait]({{<docsref "/action/init-wait">}}), [repeat]({{<docsref "/action/repeat">}}), and [repeat-interval]({{<docsref "/action/repeat-interval">}}). By default, all these columns are hidden to reduce UI clutter. However, this function allows you to display or hide them as needed. Note that hiding a column does not affect its functionality; it only clears the UI clutter by reducing the number of visible columns.
