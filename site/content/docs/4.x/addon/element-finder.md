### Check browser default functions
Now its possible you can check or compare with `date` and `time` and make the [Action]({{<docsref "/action/overview">}}) work accordingly. All you have to do is instead of Element finder try adding `Func::new Date().getHours()` to get the system current hour and it will be in 24 hours. now add condition greater than less than. which ever condition you want and in value field add hour. and under Recheck add SKIP if not matched.

| `Func::`                  | Result |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `Other`                   | Currently we have not tested all functions but will test and keep updating this list.                                                                                                                   |

#### Func methods
One important warning in advance: Malicious scripts can violate your privacy and act on your behalf!
- You should create script own. for simpler functionality like calling a function and all.
- If you not sure how to what all functions are available then You should only run scripts from sources you trust.

### Get Element By Id

### Query Selector All
{{<callout warning>}}
#### Important
Its similar to query selector which selects all matching element rather than selecting first matching element
{{</callout>}}

### XPath
Xpath helps to track down and element using its document chain examples are below. 

{{<callout warning>}}
  Combine [batch-repeat]({{<docsref "/configuration/batch#repeat">}}) with xpath to iterate over elements one by one. e.g if Xpath of element is like table format and you need to iterate all its row one by one. `//table/tr[1]/td[1]/button` this xpath will select button of fist row. now replace it will `//table/tr[<batchRepeat>]/td[1]/button` and under batch repeat add value like 5 or 10 based on number of rows. Now when batch repeat all [Action]({{<docsref "/action/overview">}}) one by one it will replace `<batchRepeat>` value with index from 1 to 10
