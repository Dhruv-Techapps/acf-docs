### Google Sheets API with Read-only Scope

When you grant permission, we will only access the Google Sheets that you select, and we will only be able to read the data in them. We do not collect or store any of your personal information, including your Google account credentials.

We will also use the userinfo.profile scope to show which Google account is connected. We do not store the data on our servers. We will not use this data for any purpose other than filling forms on configured website/application and showing the connected Google account.

We will not share your data with any third parties, except as required by law.
