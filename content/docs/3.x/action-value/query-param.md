      Query parameters can be defined as the optional key-value pairs that appear after the question mark in the URL. Basically, they are extensions of the URL that are utilized to help determine specific content or action based on the data being delivered. Query parameters are appended to the end of the URL, using a <kbd>?</kbd>. The question mark sign is used to separate path and query parameters.<br/>
      If you want to add multiple query parameters, an  <kbd>&</kbd> sign is placed in between them to form what is known as a query string. It can feature various object types with distinct lengths such as arrays, strings, and numbers.
